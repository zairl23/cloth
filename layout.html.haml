        %p We are at the pivotal juncture in human history.The shift to a new reality will be more encompassing than anything that has ever happened before to Earth-humans, and, most likely, more dramatic than imaginable.Where we go from here is largely determined by you and the other people of this planet. We can continue in our mode of violence and self-destruction, or we can choose to embrace a higher way to live.Contact with extraplanetary and intraplanetary beings is but the tip of the new reality iceberg. Almost every facet of our current existence is a lie, a lie perpetuated by those who enslave us.Each of us should take careful note, and consider whether they wish to act in accordance with the Cosmic Paradigm:There is much more than the physical reality we normally experience. We are here, on this planet, at this moment in time, by our own choice. We are here to actively participate in the transition of humanity.The universe is teeming with life. There is one Creator and there are trillions of non-human life forms, some similar to us. Off-planet beings have been here for many thousands of years, with mixed agendas.We are being invited to become members of the cosmic family. To qualify, we must reverse this planet from its current devolving condition, and we must do it very soon. We, the humans of this planet, are the only ones to make this happen. Our current leaders will not do it for us. Extraterrestrials will not do it for us. We are the ones who must act — now.We are more individually powerful than we have been taught. Collectively we have the power to create a veritable paradise.Extraterrestrial contact is but the starting point to an understanding of the facets of this pivotal juncture in human history. If you would go beyond the phenomenon, then examine the Spectrum of Reality, the messages from extraterrestrials, and the Implications of extraterrestrial contact — all presented at this site.The real story is WHY extraterrestrials are here, WHAT they are communicating to us, and WHAT it means in terms of who we are and the world on which we live.Be sure to visit other pages of this site — many have been recently updated. Current news is updated daily with articles from around the globe.
